**THIS RPC IS BUILD SPECIFICALLY FOR THE NEEDS OF AN EXCHANGE.**

The JSON-RPC was created to aid organizations with the integration of ARK in their existing RPC based infrastructure. If you do not have anay restrictions in your IT architecture, we recommend using the [Public API](/public/getting-started) over the JSON-RPC. All operations provided by the JSON-RPC can be performed using the public API.

The formal specification for the JSON-RPC API is found here. For [examples](https://docs.ark.io/exchanges/json-rpc) and [recommendations](https://docs.ark.io/exchanges/json-rpc-quick) follow the links.
